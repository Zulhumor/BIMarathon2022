QS World University Rankings 2022

Many high school students and their parents around the world face the inevitable dilemma of choosing a university. Most of the universities have rankings and those rankings are influential. Rankings attract many parties such as students, parents, researchers, potential faculty members, and funders. University rankings are determined by many aspects such as research achievements, teaching and international outlook because some student’s need to study abroad.
